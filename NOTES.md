So what I learnt while doing this project?

Learnt a bit of CSS transfom property. Got decent idea of how to use eventlistener in javascript learnt about selectors , also got an idea how to use javascript to add a class to any particular query. Used setTimeout function to remove the added class after a certain amount of time. Got a bit idea about JS functions and objects and above all learnt how to play audio in a website.

Issues faced: adding a default class to the button element to put a transform effect when pressed and also remove it after a certain amount of timeperiod
